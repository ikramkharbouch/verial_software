Essential Settings for Your MVP
These are foundational settings that directly support core app functionality and user experience:

User Management (if applicable)

Add/Edit/Delete users (if the app is multi-user).
Set roles or permissions (e.g., admin, cashier).
System Preferences

Default currency (e.g., Moroccan Dirham).
Default measurement units (e.g., tire dimensions in inches or millimeters).
File/Report Settings

Choose default file format for exports (PDF, CSV).
Set default save location for files.
Backup and Restore

Simple button to manually back up or restore app data (local storage or a file).
Optional Settings (Future Updates)
You can add these later to enhance the app:

Language and Localization

Language options (e.g., English, French, Arabic).
Date and time format preferences.
Theme Settings

Light/Dark mode toggle.
Custom theme colors (if desired).
Integration Settings

Connect to external systems (e.g., accounting software or cloud storage).
API keys for third-party services (if any).
Notification Preferences

Enable/disable notifications for low stock, overdue invoices, etc.
Advanced User Settings

Configure advanced permissions or access control for different users.
Warehouse Configuration

Add/Edit/Delete warehouse locations.
Set inventory thresholds (e.g., minimum stock levels for alerts).
